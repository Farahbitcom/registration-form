# Registration-Login-Form  

A dynamic and user-friendly Registration and Login page developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface allows users to smoothly switch between the login and registration forms with a single click, without reloading the page. This project demonstrates effective use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation, interactive UI behavior, and clean, responsive form design.
